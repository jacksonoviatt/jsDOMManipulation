        <h1>Megafauna</h1>
        <p class="desktopParagraph">In terrestrial zoology, the megafauna (from Greek μέγας megas "large" and New Latin fauna "animal life")
            comprises the large or giant animals of an area, habitat, or geological period. The most common thresholds
            used
            are weight over 40 kilograms or 44 kilograms (i.e., having a mass comparable to or
            larger than a human) or over a tonne, 1,000 kilograms (i.e., having a mass comparable to or
            larger than an ox). The first of these include many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such
            as
            white-tailed deer and red kangaroo.
